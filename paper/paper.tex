  \begin{abstract}
    \noindent Extending the work of \citep{boguth_2023}, we propose a method to measure the level of market inefficiency using unbiasedness regressions.
    We find that the market is not uniformly efficient and goes through periods of higher inefficiency reverting to efficiency in-line with \cite{lo_amh}'s adaptive 
    market hypothesis. We find that the value spread—the ratio of expensive to cheap stock P/B—is cointegrated with market inefficiency. 
    By demonstrating that wider value spreads align with greater market inefficiency, we can empirically support \citet{asness_2024}'s intuition 
    that high spreads during events such as the dot-com bubble and Covid-19 could reflect mispricing rather than fundamental changes. 
    This evidence strengthens the case that the value premium is still alive but has been masked by market inefficiency. 
    We also find that the market's temporary inefficiencies have grown more persistent over time.
