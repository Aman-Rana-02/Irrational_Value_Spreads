\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced the $Beta\_SSE$ score, a measure of market inefficiency based on the unbiasedness regressions framework.
We found that the market is not uniformly efficient, but instead goes through cycles of inefficiency followed by reversion to efficiency.
Over the last decade, inefficiency has been increasing, suggesting that the market has become less adept at incorporating available information into prices on longer time-scales.
This rising inefficiency is correlated with the widening value spread, indicating a strong link between the weakness of the value premium and market inefficiency.
Causality between the two is not established, and can be investigated in a future work. However, this paper compliments the intuition 
presented in \citet{asness_2024} that the value premium has been weakening over the last decade because of market inefficiency.
